## Overview

RTX Mega Geometry (RTX MG) is a DX12 and Vulkan code sample that shows how to quickly
build ray-tracing acceleration structures for subdivision surfaces with structured
clusters. It contains a reference HLSL path tracing demo app that can be used as a
learning tool to begin integration with your own graphics engine.

## Features

* Real-time adaptive sampling of Catmull-Clark limit surfaces
* Structured cluster tessellation and displacement mapping
* BVH build with cluster templates using NVAPI for DXR, and the VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure extension for Vulkan.
* Hierarchical Z-buffer for reducing tessellation rate of non-primary ray geometry
* DLSS Ray Reconstruction denoising

## Requirements

To Run:
- Windows 10
- NVIDIA RTX GPU (10 GB VRAM or greater)
- GeForce Game Ready Driver 570 or later
- DirectX Raytracing 1.1 API or later

To Build:
- CMake v3.31+
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.20348.0 or later
- MSVC Compiler 19.43.34810 (Visual Studio 2022 17.13) or later
- For Windows: DirectX 12 AgilitySDK will be fetched automatically
- For Vulkan: Vulkan SDK 1.4.313 or later

## Build

At the moment, only Windows builds are supported.

1. Clone the repository **with all submodules recursively**:
   
   `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/rtxmg.git`

2. Use CMake to configure the build and generate the project files.
   
   ```
   cd rtxmg
   cmake CMakeLists.txt -B ./build
   ```

   Use `-G "some tested VS version"` if specific Visual Studio or other environment 
   version required. Make sure the x64 platform is used. 

3. Build the solution generated by CMake in the `./build/` folder.

   For example, if using Visual Studio, open the generated solution `build/rtxmg.sln` 
   and build it.

4. Select and run the `rtxmg_demo` project. Binaries get built to the `bin` folder. 
   Media assets are loaded from the `assets` folder.


 ## User Interface

Once the application is running, most of the SDK features can be accessed via the
UI window on the left hand side. The UI is self-documenting : hover the mouse over
widgets to read tool-tips. See the <a href="docs/QuickStart.md">Quick Start guide</a>
for more details.

Camera can be moved using W/S/A/D keys and rotated by dragging with the left mouse
cursor.  Holding the Alt key and left-click dragging will orbit the camera around
the scene's center.

## Command Line

- `-mf` loads a specific .scene.json or OBJ file; 
  example: `-mf programmer-art.scene.json`
- `-d` to enable the graphics API debug layer or runtime, 
  and the [NVRHI](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NVRHI) validation layer.
 
Additional command line flags can be found by running with the `-h` flag.
